# kijiji-scraper
Intended to pull ad info from kijiji to build a database of cars, classified ads, and ultimately a kijiji price index.

The class Link is contained in the module XX, and is used to grab the most recently posted links for a given category and location on kijiji. 

The function getattrib is used with a individual ad url to pull the ad attributes and return them in dictionary form with key value pairs. 

The class XX uses the Link class and getattrib function to maintain and update a database of kijiji ads. The database is a XX datatype.
